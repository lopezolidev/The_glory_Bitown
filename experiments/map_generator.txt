Hello chat gpt, I need a map made out of characters of 10000 cells, that is 100 rows by 100 columns. This map will be contained with walls ( * ), or giants ( GX ), the 'X' in Giants stands for their life points, which vary from 20 to 35. Also, you will include free roads wich are represented by dots ( . ). These are the only possible cells that can be crossed.
The enemies are giants ( GX ), Orcs ( OX ) their life points go from 10 to 20, and Slimes ( SX ) their life points vary form 1 to 5. The Giants count as walls, the other two don't.

Place an Entry Portal ( PE ) and an exit Portal ( PS ) in the borders of the map.

The cells are conformed this way:
' * ' → one cell
' . ' → one cell
' GX ' → one cell (reminder: Giants life goes from 20 to 35, that would be in example as: ' G25 ')
' OX ' → one cell (reminder: Orcs life goes from 10 to 20, that would be in example as: ' O15 ')
' SX ' → one cell (reminder: Slimes life goes from 1 to 5, that would be in example as: ' S5 ')
' PE ' → one cell (reminder: this is the entry portal, placed in some cell at the border of the map)
' PS ' → one cell (reminder: this is the exit portal, placed in some cell at the border of the map)

The rest of the cells that are not enemies (' GX ', ' OX ', ' SX ') nor walls ( ' * ' ), fill them with roads ( ' . ' ). Remember that are 100 rows times 100 columns, for a total of 10000 cells.

Please do them in characters.
